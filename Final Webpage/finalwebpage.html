<p>Exercise is one of the most important facets of life for a college student. Studies conducted by different universities and research facilities (NIH and Western Kentucky University), show how important exercise is, especially for a college student.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In a 2022 study published by NIH titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9819335/" target="_blank">Physical Activity and Mental Health in Undergraduate Students</a> it was found that increased exercise can help with mental health upkeep, which in turn helps students perform better in school.
<br><br>
Universities understand the benefits that exercise has for students, and in turn provide numerous activities and amenities for the students. These include club and intramural sports,many on campus gymnasiums and exercise rooms, swimming pools and many others. 
<br><br>
<p>The University of Maryland at College Park has around 192 acres of outdoor recreation space and 400, 872 square feet of indoor recreation facility space, all available for students to use. 
<br><br>
There are over 40 student-led club sports at the University of Maryland, which allow for students to practice and compete against other universities club sports teams. 
<br><br>
Like many other big universities, UMD provides different exercise classes that students can take advantage of. The school offers spin classes, yoga classes and many more. 
<br><br>
Junior Jamie Narciso recently utilized this amenity, taking a boxing class. Narciso says the ability to exercise “makes (her) feel more confident, energized, and makes me feel like I'm succeeding.”

Although there are numerous benefits of getting exercise, some people use the school's athletic amenities to better themselves in other ways. Vincent Zhong, the captain of the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team at UMD says “It’s a community I love. I love playing the sport, but it’s the people that I stay for.” 
<br><br>

A report released by Colorado Technical University says that both physical activity and social activity can stimulate the production of new cells in the brain. 
<br><br>

Participating in a club or intramural sports as well as going to the university hosted exercise classes allows for the opportunity of both.
