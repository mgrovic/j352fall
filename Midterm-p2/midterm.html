<aside class="pquote"> <blockquote> <h4>What makes a ski resort great?</h4></blockquote> </aside> 

 <p>The answer to that question depends entirely on who’s asking it. For the most diehard, challenging terrain tops the list. For those traveling with people of different skill levels,
it’s enough varied terrain to go around. 

<p>For more mellow-minded skiers,
it’s perfect corduroy. In light of that, the very best resorts on the
continent just might be the most well-rounded destinations, where a bit of
everything is on offer. This list below is a compilation of the top-ranked resorts in the East and
West, as voted by you, the readers, in our 2022 Reader Resort Survey. From
classic Vermont resorts with iconic narrow and gladed runs to the wide-
open, powder-choked bowls of the West, there are ski resorts on this list
guaranteed to delight skiers of all stripes.</p>

<p><em>Sugarloaf is a picture of pristine natural beauty that has some of the
best terrain in the East. It’s also somewhat isolated, a fact which can
add to its appeal or make it seem like a mountain too far.</em></p>


<p>What Readers Say</p>
<aside class="pquote"> <blockquote> <h4>“I have been a LOAFER since 1972."</h4></blockquote> </aside>
<p>"While the ride from MASS is about 3:45,
it is a nice, quiet, comfortable ride. The mountain is secluded and can be
cold and windy quite often but the terrain is unmatched, along with the
mountain’s commitment to their clientele. The LOAF is a huge mountain and
it all centers around one large base area, without a lot of cross-cuts,
poling, connecting lifts, etc. The loyalty of its skiers is unmatched. I
am 71 years old and next winter will be my 50th at the LOAF. My children
grew up skiing here and now I am skiing with my five grandchildren. Every
time I turn the infamous “oh my gosh corner” a couple miles from the access
road on Rt 27, I know that I AM HOME!”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Sugarloaf Resort is an accommodating mountain for skiers of all levels but
it favors those who want to test their mettle in all conditions. This is
East Coast skiing at its purest, complete with wild weather, incredible
terrain, and astonishingly gorgeous views. For most New Englanders, it’s a
long road trip ... all the more reason to stick around an extra day or two.</p>

<p><em>A fun and family-friendly mountain with great tree skiing and an authentic
Western vibe, Steamboat and its accompanying town fit the bill for skiers
looking for a more down-to-earth destination that still has all the
amenities.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“A great family resort. Lots of terrain on the mountain and lots of things
to do off the hill. The area around the resort and the town have lots to
offer. Great restaurants, bars and a few breweries make Steamboat a great
destination. Spring skiing is fun and the outdoor après facilities are a
fun time. They even have live music daily outside.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Serving up a different Colorado skiing experience than what’s on tap in
the Front Range or in Southwestern Colorado, Steamboat is a little more
cowboy and little less glitzy. And that’s just fine by them. The mountain
is known for its cold, light powder and amazing tree skiing, and the
resort is in the midst of a multi-year upgrade that includes a new
gondola, new terrain, and a major facelift to the mountain village. The
town of Steamboat, down the road, is just the Western-style ski town of
postcard fame, especially if you come during the annual Winter Carnival in
January.</p>

<p><em>Cannon Mountain is known for its superb trees, stunning mountain views,
and a fine variety of terrain. The area gets enough natural snow that
local secrets are often ready to ski—if you can find them.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“The best ski resort in New Hampshire, Cannon has it all—a long season, a
great variety of terrain, from first-timer stuff to some of the hardest
lines at an Eastern resort, to its own wonderfully contained family area
of Tuckerbrook, to the awesome old-school vibes of Mittersill.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Cannon has a wealth of excellent terrain packed into a medium-sized
mountain. Mittersill is famous for its backcountry history and is now
served by lifts. Its intermediate glades are also well-known as a right of
passage for skiers who get a chance to find their flow through the trees.</p>

<p><em>Once an under-the-radar destination in the northern reaches of frigid
Montana, Whitefish has more recently attracted all types of skiers looking
for smaller crowds and friendlier faces. They’ve come to right place.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Once you have skied or snowboarded in Whitefish, </p> <aside class="pquote"> <blockquote> <h4>"you will always want to

beginners, experts and everyone in between. It has everything you want and

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Whitefish has been a rising star in our Resort Survey for the last several
years, with more and more people gaining an appreciation for the ski
area’s authentic vibe and rad terrain. There’s so much to ski here, from
leisurely groomers to some of the best powder glades in the Northern U.S.
And at the base of it all is arguably the most down-home, friendliest, and
well, real, ski towns you’ll ever have the pleasure to visit—the town of
Whitefish. It’s cold there, so come prepared, but also be prepared for
some of the best skiing and overall vibe you’ve ever experienced.</p>

<p><em>While all ski mountains revel in natural beauty, Whiteface’s location near
Lake Placid is so stunning, it’s almost not fair. The mountain throws
everything it can at you, making it a favorite among expert skiers.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Whiteface, the Olympic Mountain, dammit! Ski it if you can—groomed,
powder, ice, crud, more ice, more crud—get your shit together, sonny. This
ain’t no Disneyland, Jim. Lake Placid is a real ski town! No made-up
Austrian village made of plastic with plastic women in furs. Everyone is
welcome, everyone. And that’s the best part, no airs. Been everywhere and
this is the real shiz.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>From a distance, Whiteface Mountain’s well-named slopes look impossibly
steep. It’s not a huge mountain in terms of terrain but you better bring
your A-game when you come here to ski. Accommodations and dining in nearby
Lake Placid offset the ski-it-if-you-dare reputation of this Adirondacks
classic.</p>

<p><em>Snowbasin may not have a proper village or overnight amenities (yet), but
it more than makes up for that with legit terrain, world-class day lodges,
and fewer crowds.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“I hate letting people in on our secret but sharing is caring. Our resort
is one of the best. They work hard for opening day and maintain the
mountain so well during the ski season. It can be super busy on Saturday
but that’s because the secret is out.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>If you’re surprised to see under-the-radar Snowbasin on this list, we can
understand that. In a universe with so many big name resorts with
slopeside lodging and every guest amenity skiers can dream up, Snowbasin,
with no mountain village or town to call its own, seems more like a mom-
and-pop destination. But that’s exactly the appeal—the vibe of a smaller
ski area with the size, challenge, and variety of a major player</p>

<p><em>Jay Peak is the benefactor of gobs of natural snow—along with a history of

weather kicks into its deepest winter chill.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Ja-POW is a real saying and when you can get to Jay Peak on a powder day
you won’t be able to walk the following day. I have never skied so hard as
I have done at Jay Peak. Miles of terrain, amazing glades, and the tram is
truly unique.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Jay Peak is so far north, it’s almost in Canada. It can absolutely puke
snow for days on end, setting up some of the best tree runs anywhere in
America. The area has been subject to development over the years but it
hasn’t yet lost its hardcore spirit and remains a prime destination for
expert skiers.</p>

<p><em>A unique and authentic Southwestern culture complemented by some of the

destination.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“I love the mountain and the vibe of TSV—I’ve been traveling there every
winter for over 22 yrs. It has a feel all its own, and their Adult Ski
Week program is unparalleled—every time I go I advance my skills. Everyone
should experience Taos at least once, but it’s addicting! They get a good
amount of snow each season, but even during dry spells the snow is kept in
great condition.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>When you’re looking for a ski vacation that’s a little spicier than what’s
on tap at your average resort, Taos is a no-brainer. It’s got the terrain,
the amenities, and the culture to keep you engaged on all fronts, plus the
red and green chile sauces at Orlando’s, in town, are out of this world.
Do know that this place has some seriously gnarly terrain—hike Highline or
West Basin Ridge, or ski anything off the Kachina Chair to find out for
yourself.</p>

<p><em>Mad River Glen is a throwback mountain that values the deep, real
experience of skiing above all other things. It’s a gnarly mountain with
great variety paired with a friendly, eternally-stoked staff.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Mad River is the best in the East. It is considered to be among the
hardest. But it has easy and intermediate terrain that is beautiful. I
love the Vermont vibe, the single chair and the simple but great lodge. Do
you want to go to the real Vermont or to a slick resort? Vermont’s where
it’s at.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Mad River Glen is well-known for its toughest terrain but it’s also a
surprisingly friendly mountain. Vermonters tend to be softer on the edges
than other New England states and the welcoming vibe at Mad River is a
testament to that notion. The after-ski scene is refreshingly honest,
perhaps because it’s hard to have a bad day on such a wonderful mountain.</p>

<p><em>Telluride serves up a triple treat of wonderful and varied terrain, jaw-

great ski destination that’s less crowded than most.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Telluride is our favorite resort for two reasons. First, the most
beautiful ski area, hands down, in the US. Secondly, for the most part,
the best snow you’ll ski anywhere. A perfect blend of light, yet dense, so
you’ll ski better on this snow than on any other. A complete boost for the
ego.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>We say it over and over, because it’s true: Telluride is the full package.
An authentic, Old West-tinged town with some of the best dining and
lodging in ski country; a mountain with all terrain any level of skier
could ask for, including great hike-to and backcountry access; and San
Juan mountain views that go on forever. If there’s a drawback, it’s that
it’s far from anywhere—but hey, that keeps the crowds at bay.</p>

<p><em>Killington is a big mountain that has evolved over the years to

<p><em>Four distinct mountains anchored by a famous ski town that lives up to its
reputation, Aspen Snowmass offers more than meets the eye.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Aspen is a wonderful vacation for Coloradans looking to get away from the
closer-to-Denver mountains. Downtown Aspen is fantastic and as a somewhat
local you can still feel at home and not under the pressure to buy into a
ritzy trip. Highlands is a family favorite, but Bonnie’s at Ajax is still
one of the best—take a break to grab a sweet treat and coffee.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Four mountains, oodles of all types of terrain, and one fabulous ski town
make Aspen Snowmass among the best ski destinations on the planet. From
Ajax’s local vibe and stellar tree skiing to the family mecca of Snowmass
and the iconic steep, open bowl skiing of Aspen Highlands, this resort
will keep all levels of skiers engaged and impressed with all there is on
offer. While Aspen is perhaps the archetypal ski town, Snowmass Village
has been the site of most of the upgrades in recent years, and is worth
checking out for new dining, lodging, and off-slope activities, especially
if you have kids in tow. And if you’re an expert skier and you haven’t
skied Highland Bowl, it’s truly bucket-list worthy.</p>

terrain. Not the most vertical, but the most for the vertical it has! It
is the gold standard that I use for comparison and recommendations to
others.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Holiday Valley trades sheer vertical for laps and somehow pulls it off
with seamless style. There are 60 trails over 290 acres, which offers a
surprising amount of variety for a mountain that only boasts 750 vertical
feet of elevation gain. The excellent accommodations, dining, and laid-
back spirit make this one of the very best ski destinations in the East.</p>

<p><em>Deer Valley’s customer service is legendary, as is its groomers and on-
mountain food, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find some of the best
tree-skiing in the region and considerable steeps, as well.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Deer Valley has been the best resort we have skied at thus far. The
customer service is exceptional, the Utah powder is like no other, the
food/restaurants/amenities/après both at the resort, and in town, are
exceptional. I recommend Deer Valley, and Park City, to everyone. These
are the reasons why we have skied there numerous times and will continue
to go back every opportunity we get.”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Deer Valley might have a certain reputation as a super-exclusive
destination, but anyone who’s been will tell you that it doesn’t feel that
way at all when you’re there, thanks in large part to some of the
friendliest and most welcoming staff in skidom. It also has a reputation
for having some of the best food in the industry, and we can definitely
say that that’s indeed true. While we’re on the topic of reputations, Deer
Valley’s groomers are stellar, but so are its glades. And don’t sleep on
the Daly Chutes for some really fun—and often empty—steeps on Empire
Mountain.</p>

<p1> Location of Smugglers' Notch Resort </p1>
</div>
<div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell" class="center" style="background-color:#f4f4f4;" align="center">
<p><em>Locally owned and operated, this iconic ski mountain has stayed the course
over the years with great skiing, friendly confines, and as luck would
have it, pretty good natural snowfall.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“I have been going to Smuggs since I was 4 and now I take my own kids
there. They have learned to ski from the wonderful instructors and are
masters of the mountain. Each time we go they gain more confidence, and
Smuggs is literally their favorite place to go!”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Smugglers’ Notch hits a sweet spot with everything that is great about
skiing. It’s got a wide swath of varied terrain, it’s family-friendly but
also primed for experts, its views are stellar, and it’s not so far away
that you have to plan a caravan to get there. It’s independently owned and
heavily invested in the local community, so it’s very easy to overlook the
lack of a high-speed lift.</p>

<p><em>Nestled into its very own wintry nook, Sun Valley has all the components
of a perfect ski vacation, from the terrain across two separate mountains
and the town of Ketchum just down the road.</em></p>

<p>What Readers Say</p>
<p>“Sun Valley is just magical. The village and the Lodge can’t be topped.
The mountain is perfectly maintained and has perfect pitch on every run.
The history makes it fun to be a part of. The Holding family are supreme
stewards of this jewel.“</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Visiting Sun Valley is like entering into a winter wonderland that’s just
far enough off the beaten path to have a magic all its own, from the
perfectly groomed slopes with amazing Wood River Valley views to quaint
yet sophisticated Ketchum, lined with trendy restaurants, shops, and bars.
It’s a place that truly feels like a vacation, with great service on and
off the hill and lodging options ranging from the iconic Sun Valley Lodge
to the sleek Limelight Ketchum. The skiing? It’s better than ever this
year with the addition of the new Sunrise expansion, 350 acres of new
expert terrain with a distinct backcountry feel.</p>
